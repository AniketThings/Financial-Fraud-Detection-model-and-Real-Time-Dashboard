# Real-Time Fraud Detection Simulator

## Project Description

This project simulates real-time transaction processing and fraud detection using JavaScript and Chart.js. It generates random transaction data every 800 milliseconds, applies heuristic fraud detection rules, and dynamically updates statistics, alerts, and visual charts on the web page. The simulator demonstrates how fraud types vary over time and highlights fraudulent activity patterns by hour, offering insights for real-time monitoring and analysis.
